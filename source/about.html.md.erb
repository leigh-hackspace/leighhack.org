## ABOUT

Leigh Hackspace is an inclusive shared workspace for makers, artists, creators, ‘hackers’, crafters, designers, fixers, geeks and nerds from Leigh and the entire surrounding area.

Many people in our area and across the North West would like to participate in and learn crafts and making type activities, but often lack the free space at home to do this. Perhaps they also don’t have access to the very expensive tools and equipment that you would need when doing crafts. Most importantly, sometimes people don’t have access to someone who can help them learn, or inspire them, or even just provide the ‘social scene’ around making things.

Becoming a member of Leigh Hackspace solves all the above problems – we provide workspace, inspiration, equipment, ideas, support, training and even some materials for ‘hacking’ with, as well as great coffee, a community spirit and a ‘can-do’ atmosphere.

Note that ‘Hackspaces’ have nothing to do with computer ‘hacking’ (although it’s a great place to come and learn how to program or otherwise master your computer).

We are located at Unit F1, The Cotton Mill, Mather Lane, Leigh, Lancashire, WN7 2PW.
